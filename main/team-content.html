          <h4>Jared Hromika MPT, FDN/IMS</h4>
          <p>Jared graduated from the University of British Columbia in 2014 with a Masters of Physical Therapy and moved to the Comox Valley with his wife in the summer of 2015. Before moving to the valley, he worked in Vancouver at several locum positions in private practice orthopaedics in order to gain exposure to different patient populations and approaches to treatment. This experience has helped Jared consider movement problems from different perspectives while providing a framework for his post graduate development.</p>
          <p>Jared’s approach to treatment involves movement assessment, manual therapy techniques, and exercise prescription in order to help you move more effectively and with less pain. He also has additional training with Neurokinetic Therapy, which is a method of assessment and treatment for compensation patterns that have developed over the years and often go unnoticed. This helps direct treatment towards the cause of your symptoms and improve your overall quality of movement.</p>
          <p>In addition to physiotherapy treatment, Jared is excited to provide Ascent Physiotherapy with bike fitting services.  He was introduced to triathlon in 2006 and has enjoyed working on his bikes ever since. While enrolled in the masters program at UBC, he completed additional training through the BC Division of Sport Physiotherapy Canada for rider assessment and bike fit to optimize a rider’s efficiency and comfort in the saddle.</p>
          <p>When he’s not in the clinic or on his bike, Jared enjoys many activities including swimming, trail running, softball and hockey.</p>
